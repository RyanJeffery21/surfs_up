Statistics for June

- As these charts show, June has a higher average temperature.  This average temperature difference is quite low and should not lead the investors to believe there would be a significant difference in business due to the change in temperature.
- These charts also show that December receives more precipitation on average, but again, it is not statistically significant enough to warrant a concern.
- It would appear from the data that during both months, most of the rainfall comes in large storms that produce multiple inches of precipitation while most days are rain free.  

# Summary

W. Avy's main concern was being rained out of business and the data does not support this concern.  Comparing June and December, the data shows that both months are relatively close to each other in both temperature and precipitation.  Before investing, the full year should be treated the same way and see if there could be concern in the other ten months of the year.
